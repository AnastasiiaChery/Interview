## Overview of Cloud Computing

Cloud computing is a model of using IT resources defined by the U.S. National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST). It is based on five essential characteristics:

1. **On-Demand Self-Service**  
   Users can provision computing resources such as processing power, storage, and networking automatically through a web interface, without human intervention from the provider.

2. **Broad Network Access**  
   Resources are accessible over the internet from anywhere with a connection.

3. **Resource Pooling**  
   The provider pools computing resources to serve multiple customers. Resources are dynamically allocated, and users do not need to know the physical location of the infrastructure.

4. **Rapid Elasticity**  
   Resources can be scaled up or down quickly depending on demand.

5. **Measured Service**  
   Customers pay only for the resources they use. If usage stops, billing stops.

### Evolution Toward the Cloud

Cloud computing evolved in three major waves:

- **Colocation** – Companies rented physical space in data centers instead of owning real estate.
- **Virtualized Data Centers** – Infrastructure components (servers, CPUs, storage, load balancers) became virtualized, but enterprises still managed and configured their own environments.
- **Container-Based Cloud Architecture** – Fully automated and elastic systems where services automatically provision and configure infrastructure.

Today, companies increasingly rely on cloud platforms to build scalable, data-driven software. As technology becomes central to business strategy, organizations are evolving into data-driven companies.


## Cloud Service Models: IaaS, PaaS, Serverless, and SaaS

The shift to virtualized data centers introduced two main cloud service models: **Infrastructure as a Service (IaaS)** and **Platform as a Service (PaaS)**.

### Infrastructure as a Service (IaaS)
IaaS provides raw compute, storage, and networking resources, organized virtually like a traditional physical data center.

- Customers manage the infrastructure configuration.
- Resources are allocated in advance.
- Payment is based on the resources provisioned.

Example: Compute Engine (Google Cloud).

### Platform as a Service (PaaS)
PaaS provides a platform where code is connected to managed libraries and services that handle infrastructure needs.

- Developers focus more on application logic.
- Infrastructure management is handled by the provider.
- Payment is based on actual resource usage.

Example: App Engine (Google Cloud).

### Managed Infrastructure and Managed Services
As cloud computing evolved, the focus shifted toward managed services.

Benefits:
- Less time and money spent on infrastructure maintenance.
- Greater focus on business goals.
- Faster and more reliable product delivery.

---

### Serverless Computing
Serverless is the next stage of cloud evolution.

- Developers focus only on writing code.
- No infrastructure management required.
- Fully managed execution environment.
- Pay-as-you-go pricing model.

Examples:
- Cloud Run — deploy containerized microservices in a fully managed environment.
- Cloud Run functions — run event-driven code as a managed service.

---

### Software as a Service (SaaS)
SaaS delivers the entire application stack as a cloud-based service.

- Applications run in the cloud.
- No local installation required.
- Accessed directly over the internet by end users.

Examples:
- Gmail
- Google Docs
- Google Drive

These applications are part of Google Workspace and are consumed directly as services.
